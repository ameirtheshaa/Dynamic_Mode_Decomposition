        The Lorenz system is a simplified mathematical model for atmospheric convection, introduced by Edward Lorenz in 1963. It is described by the following system of ordinary differential equations:

        ```
        dx/dt = σ(y - x)
        dy/dt = x(ρ - z) - y
        dz/dt = xy - βz
        ```

        Where:
        - σ (sigma) is the Prandtl number
        - ρ (rho) is the Rayleigh number
        - β (beta) is a physical proportion

        For the classical parameter values (σ=10, β=8/3, ρ=28), the system exhibits chaotic behavior, characterized by:
        - Sensitivity to initial conditions (the "butterfly effect")
        - Strange attractor geometry
        - Non-repeating, deterministic trajectories
        - Positive Lyapunov exponent

        ## DMD Analysis of Lorenz System

        Dynamic Mode Decomposition provides insight into:
        1. The dominant coherent structures (modes) in the Lorenz system
        2. Their oscillation frequencies and growth/decay rates
        3. How well a linear approximation can capture this nonlinear, chaotic system
        4. Prediction capabilities and limitations

        ## Physical Interpretation of DMD Modes in Lorenz System

        The DMD modes of the Lorenz system typically correspond to:
        - Mode pairs representing oscillatory behavior around the attractor wings
        - Modes capturing transitions between attractor lobes
        - Modes representing average flow or baseline state
        - Higher-order modes capturing finer details of the chaotic dynamics

        ## Lyapunov Exponents

        The Lorenz system is characterized by its Lyapunov exponents, which for the standard parameters (σ=10, β=8/3, ρ=28) are approximately:
        - λ₁ ≈ 0.906 (positive, indicating chaos)
        - λ₂ ≈ 0 (zero, indicating a conserved quantity)
        - λ₃ ≈ -14.572 (negative, indicating strong contraction)

        The presence of a positive Lyapunov exponent confirms the chaotic nature of the system and explains why long-term predictions are fundamentally limited even with advanced methods like DMD.
